External cheat for CS2

It was made just in educational purposes

It's and external cheat for CS2 (With easy offsets updating process, just c+p from https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/blob/main/generated/client.dll.hpp to global_offsets)
The main feature of this project is making a read\write memory cheat without hooking, etc. Mainly using WinAPI and ImGui (maybe i'll add driver r\w memory later)
